Richard Hamming, the inventor of Hamming codes, worked at Bell Labs in the late 1940s on the Bell Model V computer,
an electromechanical relay-based machine with cycle times in seconds. Input was fed in on punched paper tape,
seven-eighths of an inch wide, which had up to six holes per row. During weekdays, when errors in the relays were detected,
the machine would stop and flash lights so that the operators could correct the problem. During after-hours periods and on weekends,
when there were no operators, the machine simply moved on to the next job.

Hamming worked on weekends, and grew increasingly frustrated with having to restart his programs from scratch due to detected errors.
In a taped interview, Hamming said, "And so I said, 'Damn it, if the machine can detect an error,
why can't it locate the position of the error and correct it?'".[3] Over the next few years,
he worked on the problem of error-correction, developing an increasingly powerful array of algorithms.
In 1950, he published what is now known as Hamming code, which remains in use today in applications such as ECC memory.
